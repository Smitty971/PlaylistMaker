This was built for Flatiron School as a module 4 JS-Rails Project. This is a SPA or Single Page Application. It consists of a Rails API Backend to handle data and a Vanilla JavaScript Frontend for the UI.

  

PlayListMaker is for people who want to make music playlists based on the genre of the music. For now it only contains a few genres but more may be added in the future.![screenshot
